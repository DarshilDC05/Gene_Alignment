# Gene_Alignment

This repository has files associated with a dynamic programming algorithms that is used to align 2 genes, or any sequence of strings. This algorithm is called `Needleman-Wunch Algorithm`.

## How to run

Enter the 2 Strings/DNA sequences in [s1](s1.txt) and [s2](s2.txt) respectively. Run the `.exe` file from command line with `s1.txt` and `s2.txt` as its arguments. Use the command

```text
./seq_align.exe s1.txt s2.txt
```

and you will get the aligned genes as output in the terminal with necessary gaps and changes done.
